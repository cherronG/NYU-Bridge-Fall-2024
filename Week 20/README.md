# Week 20: Trees
This week we will be continuing our discussion on data structures. Please read all of chapter 4, and this Wikipedia article on Red-Black Trees, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree.

## Objectives
The data structure we are discussing this week is Trees. Ultimately, we would like you to be able to understand how these fundamental data types work and are used in Computer Science.

At the end of the week, you should be able to:
- Understand what a Tree is
- Understand Binary Search Trees
- Understand tree traversals (Pre, Post, In Order, and Level Order)
- Be able to choose an appropriate data structure for a task
