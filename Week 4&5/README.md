# Week 4&5: Iterative Statements and Functions
This week we will see some more statements that are used to control the flow of our programs. We will go over while and for loops. These statements allow us to repeat a set of statements over and over.

By using iterative statements, we will be able to express computations that are much more complex. Mastering in using iterative processes takes time, and requires a lot of practice. Make sure you save enough time for practice.

In addition, we will work on our Mathematical skills, and introduce the function notion.

## Objectives
Make sure that by the end of this week you:
- Are familiar with the syntax of the basic iterative statements in C++ (while, for)
- Are able to write programs that use iterative control
- Are familiar with the pigeonhole principle
- Practiced a lot with the above topics
- Understand the definition of a (mathematical) function
- Are familiar with the terms: domain, target, range
- Know what is one-to-one function, what is an onto function, and what is a bijection. Be able to determine whether a function has one or more of the above properties
- Understand how to compute a composition of functions
- Able to find the Inverse function of a given function, or determine that there is no such
