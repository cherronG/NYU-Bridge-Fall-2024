# Week 12: Recursion and Induction 
This week we will talk about a new and powerful problem-solving technique â€“ recursions. We will start by reviewing mathematical induction and an extended form of it (called strong induction). We will see that there is a close relation between mathematical induction, as a proving technique, and recursion, as a problem-solving technique. We will then go over the steps we need to take when developing a recursive algorithm.

## Objectives
Make sure that by the end of this week you:
- Are able to prove statements using the mathematical induction technique (regular form and strong induction)
- Are able to solve computational problems using recursions
- See the similarities between induction and recursion
