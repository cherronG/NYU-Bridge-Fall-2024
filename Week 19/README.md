# Week 19: Stacks and Queues
This week, we will be concentrating on data structures, and in doing so, we will be switching books to Mark Allen Weiss's “Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++” book.  If you feel you need some more practice with C++ or algorithm analysis, the first two chapters of this book are a good review.  For the readings, chapter 3 contains a lot of other information that we’ve already covered, but it would be a good review if you need it.  I’ll assign sections 3.6 and 3.7.

## Objectives 
The data structures we are discussing this week are Stacks, Queues, and Trees. Ultimately, we would like to be able to understand how these fundamental data types work and are used in Computer Science.

At the end of the week, you should be able to:
- Understand how a stack is designed
- Understand how a queue is designed
- How stacks and queues are used
