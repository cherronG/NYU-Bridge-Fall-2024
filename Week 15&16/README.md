# Week 15&16: Object-Oriented Programming
This week we will be studying object-oriented programming, including the design of classes, constructors, destructors, copy constructors, operator overloading (including the assignment operator), inheritance, and polymorphism.  This is a VERY difficult topic and a full week, so please don’t delay starting!  Thursday’s webinar will very likely take the entire three hours, and please make sure you are prepared by completing the required readings and reviews before then!

Object orientation came about in the mid-1980s as a concept to keep data and the functions to work on the data together.  Since then, a lot of development has been done and today object orientation is expected in a lot of situations.  Java, for example, is a purely object-oriented language; everything is an object!


## Objectives
By the end of this week, you should:
- Be able to define classes and use them properly
- Understand "encapsulation"
- Understand Public, Private, and Protected
- Be able to overload the following operators: +,-,++,--,*,*=,<<,>>,<,=,[ ]
- Understand the Big 3 and when they are needed
- Understand when to implement as a member, non-member friend, and non-member non-friend
- Understand that inheritance implements the "is-a" relationship
- Understand and be able to use polymorphism for late/dynamic binding
