# NYU Tandon Bridge Program Fall 2024 (28-week course)
This repository documents my experience during the Bridge course at NYU Tandon, showcasing selected homework assignments.

## Course Description
The NYU Tandon Bridge program is an intensive, fully online course designed to prepare students without a technical background for STEM graduate programs. A curriculum typically requiring 3-4 semesters is condensed into a 21- or 28-week format. Taught by NYU Tandon Computer Science faculty, the program covers discrete math, data structures, algorithms, and operating systems through interactive modules, live webinars, assignments, and exams. Students should expect up to 100 hours of study, averaging 30-40 hours per week, with flexible scheduling and a required weekly online meeting. Upon completion, students earn a certificate that strengthens their master's application and grants a waiver for the application fee and GRE requirements.

## Course Objectives
- Basic understanding of data representation, how computers process and manipulate data to solve problems, and how to develop algorithms using decision-making, loops, and decomposition to solve problems
- Proficiency in implementing, testing, and debugging moderately complex C++ programs using variables, operators, functions, and built-in data types
- Basic understanding of basic object-oriented programming principles and the ability to work with fundamental data structures, including analyzing their performance and modifying them
- Strong grasp of operating system concepts, including processes, threads, concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management
- Solid foundation in discrete mathematics concepts

## Course Topics
- **Computer Science Fundamentals:** coding functions, abstraction, runtime stack, compilation, execution process, data types, expressions, branching statements, iterative statements, recursion
- **Programming and Data Structures:** arrays, strings, pointers, dynamic allocation, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, binary search trees, searching, sorting, object-oriented programming concepts
- **Mathematics and Logic:** discrete probability, induction, introduction to counting, logic, mathematical functions, number systems, proofs, sets
- **Operating Systems and Computer Architecture:** fundamentals of system hardware, intro to OS concepts, memory management, processes, threads, thread concurrency, deadlocks
- **Networking and Communication:** introduction to networking, physical layout of networks, overview of OSI/RM, application layer, network layer, transport layer
