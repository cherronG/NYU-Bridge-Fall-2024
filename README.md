# NYU Tandon Bridge Program Fall 2024 (28-week course)
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic journey through the NYU Tandon Bridge program, showcasing selected homework assignments and weekly progress. The repository covers 24 weeks of coursework, with gaps representing exam weeks (6, 14, 21, 28) and catch-up weeks (13, 27).

## Program Description
The NYU Tandon Bridge program is an intensive, fully online course designed to prepare students without a technical background for STEM graduate programs. This rigorous curriculum condenses what typically requires 3-4 semesters into a 28-week format. Taught by NYU Tandon Computer Science faculty, the program covers discrete math, data structures, algorithms, and operating systems through interactive modules, live webinars, assignments, and exams. Students should expect up to 100 hours of study, averaging 30-40 hours per week, with flexible scheduling and a required weekly online meeting. Upon completion, students earn a certificate that strengthens their master's application and grants a waiver for the application fee and GRE requirements.

## Program Objectives
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Understanding of data representation, computer processing, and algorithm development using decision-making, loops, and decomposition
- **Programming Proficiency:** Ability to implement, test, and debug complex C++ programs using variables, operators, functions, and built-in data types
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Grasp of OOP principles and experience with fundamental data structures, including performance analysis
- **Systems Knowledge:** Strong understanding of operating system concepts including processes, threads, concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management
- **Mathematical Foundation:** Solid grounding in discrete mathematics concepts

## Course Topics
- **Computer Science Fundamentals:** coding functions, abstraction, runtime stack, compilation, execution process, data types, expressions, branching statements, iterative statements, recursion
- **Programming and Data Structures:** arrays, strings, pointers, dynamic allocation, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, binary search trees, searching, sorting, object-oriented programming concepts
- **Mathematics and Logic:** discrete probability, induction, introduction to counting, logic, mathematical functions, number systems, proofs, sets
- **Operating Systems and Computer Architecture:** fundamentals of system hardware, intro to OS concepts, memory management, processes, threads, thread concurrency, deadlocks
- **Networking and Communication:** introduction to networking, physical layout of networks, overview of OSI/RM, application layer, network layer, transport layer
- **File and System Processing:** file processing, intro to algorithm analysis, order of growth
