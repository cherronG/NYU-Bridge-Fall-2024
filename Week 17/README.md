# Week 17: Searching and Sorting
Hopefully everyone is getting caught up with the object-oriented material and the Doodlebug problem.  Unfortunately, there’s no time to take a break!  We’re moving on, but thankfully, with a bit of an easier topic.  This week we're working on our algorithms material and will look in detail at algorithms for searching for an element in a collection of elements, and at algorithms to sort a collection of elements in increasing order.

## Objectives
By the end of this week, you should:
- Be familiar with linear search and binary search
- Be familiar with selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort (you do not need to study other sorting algorithms)
- Understand the running time analysis of the searching and sorting algorithms covered
